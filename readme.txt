= Note =
This plugin is alternative of ACF Gallery Pro. You need to have knowledge of coding because you’ll be required to edit your WordPress theme source code. If you are looking for shortcodes and prebuilt gallery then this plugin is **NOT** for you. This plugin will give you PHP array of images and you’ll need to make the gallery layout as you wish.

= Donation =

= Usage =
*acf_photo_gallery* is a helper function that takes in **ACF_FIELD_NAME** and **POST_ID** will query the database and compile the images for you. The output of this function will be an array.

`acf_photo_gallery(ACF_FIELD_NAME, POST_ID);`

= Example =
The following example is using Twitter Bootstrap framework to layout. You can use any framework of your choice.

`<?php
	//Get the images ids from the post_metadata
	$images = acf_photo_gallery('vacation_photos', $post->ID);
	//Check if return array has anything in it
	if( count($images) ):
		//Cool, we got some data so now let's loop over it
		foreach($images as $image):
			$id = $image['id']; // The attachment id of the media
			$title = $image['title']; //The title
			$caption= $image['caption']; //The caption
			$full_image_url= $image['full_image_url']; //Full size image url
			$full_image_url = acf_photo_gallery_resize_image($full_image_url, 262, 160); //Resized size to 262px width by 160px height image url
			$thumbnail_image_url= $image['thumbnail_image_url']; //Get the thumbnail size image url 150px by 150px
			$url= $image['url']; //Goto any link when clicked
			$target= $image['target']; //Open normal or new tab
			$alt = get_field('photo_gallery_alt', $id); //Get the alt which is a extra field (See below how to add extra fields)
			$class = get_field('photo_gallery_class', $id); //Get the class which is a extra field (See below how to add extra fields)
?>
<div class="col-xs-6 col-md-3">
	<div class="thumbnail">
		<?php if( !empty($url) ){ ?><a href="<?php echo $url; ?>" <?php echo ($target == 'true' )? 'target="_blank"': ''; ?>><?php } ?>
			<img src="<?php echo $full_image_url; ?>" alt="<?php echo $title; ?>" title="<?php echo $title; ?>">
		<?php if( !empty($url) ){ ?></a><?php } ?>
	</div>
</div>
<?php endforeach; endif; ?>`

= Add Extra Fields =
To add extra fields add the following to your themes functions.php file.

`//Create extra fields called Altnative Text and Status
function my_extra_gallery_fields( $args, $attachment_id, $field ){
    $args['alt'] = array(
		'type' => 'text', 
		'label' => 'Altnative Text', 
		'name' => 'alt', 
		'value' => get_field($field . '_alt', $attachment_id)
	);
    $args['status'] = array(
		'type' => 'select', 
		'label' => 'Status', 
		'name' => 'status', 
		'value' => array(
			array(
				'1' => 'Active',
				 '2' => 'Inactive'
			), 
			get_field($field . '_status', $attachment_id)
		)
	);
	return $args;
}
add_filter( 'acf_photo_gallery_image_fields', 'my_extra_gallery_fields', 10, 3 );`

Supported field types:
* text, date, color, datetime-local, email, number, tel, time, url, week, range, checkbox, radio, textarea, select

= How to get values of extra fields =
You can use ACF helper function `get_field`

`get_field('photo_gallery_alt', $id);`
`get_field('photo_gallery_class', $id);`

= Pull caption from attachment caption field =
By default the caption is being pulled from description field. Add the following filter to your `function.php` to pull the caption from attachment caption field.

`add_filter( 'acf_photo_gallery_caption_from_attachment', '__return_true' );`

= REST API =
Send HTTP Request to URL to get JSON response of all posts

`http://{domain}/wp-json/wp/v2/{POST_TYPE}/`

Send HTTP Request to URL to get JSON response of specific post

`http://{domain}/wp-json/wp/v2/{POST_TYPE}/{POST_ID}/`

When you receive the response, see the ACF item which contains ACF photo gallery name and array of images.
